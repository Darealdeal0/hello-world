Hi Halfaker Assoicates, LLC,

My name is Kyle McCoy.  I'm a new hire and would like to introduce myself.  
I have been in the IT field for the past 20 years.  I most recently worked for Mhasis, Inc. and before that At&t.
I went to school at DeVry Institute of Technology, where I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems.
While enrolled at DeVry, I participated in the Federal Work Study Program.  More specifically, I worked for the United Way 
affiliate in Irving, TX 'Irving Cares, Inc."  I setup their network topology for Windows NT.  I configured one server, and approximately 10 clients.  I also designed and implemented their intial corporate website.  I reported to Joyce Brown, the director of the company.
I also am an eight year Army Veteran.  I served as a combat medic and an administrative clerk.  I took my basic training at Fort Knox, KY.  I attended my initial AIT at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TX at the Academy of Health Sciences.  I underwent combat medical training and learned to perform emergency field triage.  My secondary AIT training was performed at Fort Chaffee, AR while serving for the Arkansas Army Reserve.
